## Features
- AI assistance for command suggestions and explanations
- P2P task sharing across collaborative networks
- Collaborative sessions with real-time sharing
- Enhanced command completion with context awareness
- Distributed execution across worker pools
- Integration with SwissKnife CLI tools

## Backend Dependencies
- **CLI engine**: Core command processing and execution
- **AI providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic for command assistance
- **P2P networking**: libp2p for collaborative sessions
- **Task distribution**: Worker coordination and job scheduling

## Development Considerations
This application requires the following backend services to be operational:
- [ ] CLI engine
- [ ] AI providers
- [ ] P2P networking
- [ ] Task distribution

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Component**: `web/js/apps/terminal.js`
- **Desktop Integration**: Application icon selector `[data-app="terminal"]`
- **Icon**: üñ•Ô∏è
- **Registered Application**: ‚úÖ Yes

## Parallel Development Strategy
To enable parallel frontend and backend development:

1. **Mock Backend Services**: Create mock implementations of CLI engine and AI providers
2. **API Contracts**: Define clear interfaces for command execution and AI assistance
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for terminal functionality
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API documentation for all services

## Technical Implementation
- **Window Management**: Professional window interface with minimize/maximize controls
- **Command Processing**: Real-time command interpretation and execution
- **AI Integration**: Context-aware command suggestions and help
- **Collaboration**: Real-time session sharing and synchronization
