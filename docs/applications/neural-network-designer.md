![neural-network-designer Icon](../screenshots/neural-network-designer-icon.png)

## Description
Visual neural network architecture design with collaborative development

## Screenshots
- **Icon**: ![Icon](../screenshots/neural-network-designer-icon.png)
- **Application Window**: ![Window](../screenshots/neural-network-designer-window.png)

## Features
- Visual design
- Real-time training
- Collaborative development
- Model export

## Backend Dependencies
- **Neural network frameworks**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Training engine**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Visualization**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Model export**: Core dependency for application functionality

## Development Considerations
This application requires the following backend services to be operational:
- [ ] Neural network frameworks
- [ ] Training engine
- [ ] Visualization
- [ ] Model export

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Component**: `web/js/apps/neural-network-designer.js`
- **Desktop Integration**: Application icon selector `[data-app="neural-network-designer"]`
- **Icon**: ðŸ§ 
- **Registered Application**: âœ… Yes

## Parallel Development Strategy
To enable parallel frontend and backend development:

1. **Mock Backend Services**: Create mock implementations of required backend dependencies
2. **API Contracts**: Define clear API contracts for all backend services
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend components
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all dependencies and their interactions
