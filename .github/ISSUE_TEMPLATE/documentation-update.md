## Documentation Issue
<!-- Describe what's wrong with the current documentation -->

## Current State
<!-- Describe the current state of the documentation -->
- [ ] Documentation is outdated
- [ ] Documentation is missing

- [ ] Documentation is empty/placeholder
- [ ] Documentation conflicts with implementation

## Target State
<!-- Describe what the documentation should look like when fixed -->

## Files to Update
<!-- List the specific documentation files that need work -->
- [ ] `README.md`
- [ ] `docs/specific-file.md`
