```

#### AI API Issues
```bash
# Test Hugging Face connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2

# Test OpenRouter connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models
```

#### P2P Connection Problems
```bash
# Test with local network only
SWISSKNIFE_P2P_LOCAL_ONLY=true npm run desktop:collaborative

# Debug P2P connections
DEBUG=swissknife:p2p npm run desktop:collaborative
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Launch without workers

## Legacy Information (CLI Development)

For developers working on the CLI components or traditional terminal-based features, the following legacy information remains relevant:

### Project Overview (CLI Architecture)

SwissKnife includes a powerful terminal-based AI coding tool built entirely in TypeScript. It provides a unified interface to interact with various AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.) for coding assistance, content generation, and complex task execution.

The core CLI architecture integrates several advanced components:
- **AI Agent**: Manages conversations, uses tools, and orchestrates complex reasoning.
- **Graph-of-Thought (GoT) Engine**: Enables non-linear problem-solving for complex tasks.
- **Enhanced TaskNet**: Features a high-performance Fibonacci Heap scheduler and advanced task decomposition/synthesis.
- **ML Engine**: Integrates local model inference capabilities using Node.js bindings.
- **Virtual Filesystem (VFS)**: Abstracts storage operations over multiple backends.
- **IPFS Integration**: Uses an IPFS client for content-addressable storage.
- **MCP Integration**: Supports acting as an MCP server and managing connections to other MCP servers.

### CLI Development Setup

For CLI development specifically:

```bash
# Run CLI development server
npm run dev:cli

# Build CLI components
npm run build:cli

# Test CLI functionality
npm run test:cli
```

### CLI Configuration (Legacy)

Traditional CLI configuration through environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
export SWISSKNIFE_MCP_URL=your_mcp_server_url
```

### Legacy Testing Status

**Total Tests Passing**: 58/58 tests (100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3 Components**: 13/13 tests passing (MerkleClock, FibonacciHeapScheduler, TaskStatus)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4 CLI Integration**: 4/4 tests passing (IPFSCommand, TaskCommand, AgentCommand, CrossIntegration)
- ‚úÖ **Utility Modules**: 41/41 tests passing (Array, Cache, Events, Performance, Workers)

For detailed CLI development information, refer to the legacy documentation sections above.
