## Implementation Approach

### Pattern Used for Fixes

1. **Identify mock indicators** in code
2. **Implement real functionality** with:
   - SwissKnife API integration where available
   - localStorage backend for data persistence
   - Proper error handling
   - Fallback behavior when APIs unavailable
3. **Remove all mock comments** and indicators
4. **Test basic functionality** to ensure no breakage
5. **Commit with descriptive messages**

### Best Practices Applied

- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Provide helpful messages when APIs not configured
- ✅ Use existing infrastructure (SwissKnife API, localStorage)
- ✅ Keep changes minimal and focused
- ✅ Preserve UI/UX while fixing backend
