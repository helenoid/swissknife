# SwissKnife Collaboration Guide

## Quick Start Guide to Real-time Collaboration

Welcome to SwissKnife's revolutionary collaborative virtual desktop! This guide will help you set up and use the P2P collaboration features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Launch Collaborative Mode
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/swissknife.git
cd swissknife
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run desktop:collaborative
```

### 2. Create or Join a Workspace
- **Create Workspace**: Click the "ü§ù Create Workspace" button in the desktop
- **Join Workspace**: Enter a workspace ID shared by a collaborator
- **Share Workspace**: Copy your workspace ID to invite others

## ü§ù Collaboration Features

### Real-time Collaborative Editing
- **VibeCode**: Multiple users can edit the same file simultaneously
- **Notes**: Shared note-taking with automatic conflict resolution
- **Terminal**: Execute commands collaboratively across peers

### File Sharing & Synchronization
- **Instant File Sharing**: Drag and drop files to share via IPFS
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes sync automatically across all peers
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging of simultaneous edits

### Distributed Task Execution
- **P2P Computing**: Heavy tasks distributed across peer network
- **AI Inference**: Share AI model inference across available peers
- **Background Processing**: Utilize idle resources from other peers

## üìÅ File Collaboration

### Sharing Files
1. Open File Manager
2. Select files to share
3. Right-click ‚Üí "Share via P2P"
4. Files become available to all workspace members

### Collaborative Editing
1. Open VibeCode
2. Create or open a shared file
3. See real-time cursors of other collaborators
4. Changes sync automatically with conflict resolution

### File Synchronization
- Files are synchronized via IPFS across all peers
- Automatic backup ensures no data loss
- Version history tracks all changes

## üåê P2P Network

### Network Status
- Green indicator: Connected to P2P network
- Yellow indicator: Connecting or limited connectivity
- Red indicator: Disconnected (check firewall/network)

### Peer Discovery
- Automatic discovery on local network
- Manual peer addition via peer ID
- WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer connections

### Network Troubleshooting
- Ensure ports 3001-3010 are available
- Check firewall settings for WebRTC
- Try connecting via different network if issues persist

## ‚ö° Distributed Computing

### Task Distribution
- Heavy computations automatically distributed
- AI inference shared across peer network
- Load balancing based on peer capabilities

### Resource Sharing
- Share CPU, GPU, and memory resources
- Automatic detection of peer capabilities
- Fair resource allocation across tasks

## üîí Security & Privacy

### End-to-End Encryption
- All P2P communications are encrypted
- File transfers use secure IPFS protocols
- No data leaves your control

### Permissions
- Fine-grained access control for shared resources
- Workspace-level permissions management
- Individual file sharing permissions

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### P2P Settings
```javascript
// In Settings app ‚Üí P2P Configuration
{
  "maxPeers": 10,
  "enableFileSharing": true,
  "enableTaskDistribution": true,
  "autoJoinWorkspaces": false
}
```

### Collaboration Preferences
- Set preferred file sync strategies
- Configure conflict resolution behavior
- Customize collaboration notifications

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Peer Network Statistics
- View connected peers and their capabilities
- Monitor data transfer rates
- Track task distribution efficiency

### Collaboration Metrics
- File sharing activity
- Real-time editing sessions
- Distributed task completion rates

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cannot Connect to Peers**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify WebRTC support in browser
- Try different workspace ID

**File Sync Problems**
- Check IPFS node status
- Verify file permissions
- Try manual sync via File Manager

**Performance Issues**
- Limit number of concurrent peers
- Reduce file sharing frequency
- Check available system resources

### Getting Help
- Check the P2P Network status in System Monitor
- Review console logs for error details
- Join our community for support

## üéØ Best Practices

### Effective Collaboration
- Use clear file naming conventions
- Communicate changes in AI Chat
- Regular workspace cleanup

### Performance Optimization
- Close unused applications
- Limit large file transfers during peak collaboration
- Use distributed computing for heavy tasks

### Security Best Practices
- Only join trusted workspaces
- Review peer permissions regularly
- Keep workspace IDs private
