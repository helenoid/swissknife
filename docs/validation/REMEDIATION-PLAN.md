|-------------|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Terminal | 1 | ⚠️ In Progress | 3 TODOs | - | 2-3 | - | ☐ |
| AI Chat | 1 | ⚠️ In Progress | 4 Mocks | - | 3-4 | - | ☐ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Resources Needed

### Development Resources:
- **Frontend Developers:** 2-3
- **Backend Developers:** 1-2
- **DevOps Engineer:** 1 (part-time)
- **QA Tester:** 1

### Infrastructure:
- AI API access (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- IPFS nodes
- P2P network infrastructure
- Testing environments

### Documentation:
- API documentation for each integration
- User guides for each application
- Developer setup guides
- Testing protocols

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks:
1. **Scope creep** - Applications may require more work than estimated
2. **API changes** - External services may change their APIs
3. **Performance issues** - Real implementations may be slower than mocks
4. **Resource constraints** - Limited developer availability

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Break work into small, testable increments
2. Use API versioning and abstractions
3. Implement caching and optimization early
4. Prioritize ruthlessly, defer low-priority items

---

## Conclusion

This remediation plan provides a structured approach to converting 44 mock/placeholder applications into real, functional implementations. By following the phased approach and prioritizing core applications first, the desktop will progressively become more useful while maintaining a working state throughout the remediation process.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Assign developers to Phase 1 applications
3. Set up tracking/monitoring system
4. Begin implementation with Terminal application
5. Regular progress reviews (weekly recommended)
