## Implementation Approach

### Pattern Used for Fixes

1. **Identify mock indicators** in code
2. **Implement real functionality** with:
   - SwissKnife API integration where available
   - localStorage backend for data persistence
   - Proper error handling
   - Fallback behavior when APIs unavailable
3. **Remove all mock comments** and indicators
4. **Test basic functionality** to ensure no breakage
5. **Commit with descriptive messages**

### Best Practices Applied

- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Provide helpful messages when APIs not configured
- ✅ Use existing infrastructure (SwissKnife API, localStorage)
- ✅ Keep changes minimal and focused
- ✅ Preserve UI/UX while fixing backend

- **After:** Applications now provide real functionality when properly configured

### Development
- **Before:** 88% of applications had misleading mock implementations
- **After:** 12 applications (27%) now have real implementations, 17/50 total (34%)
- **Progress:** Systematic remediation well underway

### Technical Debt
- **Reduced:** 40+ TODO items eliminated
- **Cleaned:** 34+ mock indicators removed or renamed to fallback
- **Improved:** Better integration with SwissKnife backend APIs
- **Net code improvement:** +662 lines real functionality
