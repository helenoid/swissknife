## Feature Description
<!-- Describe the feature that needs to be implemented or fixed -->

## Current Implementation State
<!-- Describe what's currently implemented vs what's needed -->
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] Partially implemented
- [ ] Implemented but broken
- [ ] Implemented but incomplete
- [ ] Implemented but not tested

## Requirements
<!-- Define what the feature should do -->

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2
- [ ] Requirement 3

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance requirements
- [ ] Security requirements
- [ ] Compatibility requirements

## Files to Implement/Fix
<!-- List the specific files that need work -->
- [ ] `src/feature/main.ts`
- [ ] `src/feature/helper.ts`
- [ ] `test/feature/main.test.ts`

## API Design
<!-- Define the interfaces, types, and API surface -->

```typescript
// Example interface or API
interface FeatureInterface {
  method1(param: string): Promise<Result>;
  method2(): void;
}
```

## Dependencies
<!-- List any issues that must be completed first -->
- Depends on: Infrastructure fixes (#issue-number)
- Requires: Other features (#issue-number)

## Implementation Approach
<!-- Describe the technical approach -->

### Architecture Considerations
- [ ] Fits with existing architecture
- [ ] Follows project patterns
- [ ] Maintains type safety
- [ ] Supports testing

### Technical Design
1. **Component 1**: Description
2. **Component 2**: Description
3. **Integration**: How components work together

## Testing Strategy
<!-- Define how the feature will be tested -->
- [ ] Unit tests for core logic
- [ ] Integration tests for component interaction
- [ ] End-to-end tests for user workflows
- [ ] Manual testing scenarios

## Success Criteria
<!-- Define what success looks like -->
- [ ] Feature works as designed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Design interfaces and types
2. [ ] Implement core logic
3. [ ] Add error handling
4. [ ] Write unit tests
5. [ ] Add integration tests
6. [ ] Update documentation
7. [ ] Manual testing

## Risk Assessment
<!-- What could go wrong and how to mitigate -->
- **Technical Risk**: Description and mitigation
- **Integration Risk**: Description and mitigation
- **Performance Risk**: Description and mitigation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature is fully implemented
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
