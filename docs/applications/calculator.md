## Screenshots
- **Icon**: ![Icon](../screenshots/calculator-icon.png)
- **Application Window**: ![Window](../screenshots/calculator-window.png)

## Features
- Scientific calculations
- Programmable functions
- History tracking
- Equation sharing

## Backend Dependencies
- **Mathematical engine**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Expression parser**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **History storage**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Sharing service**: Core dependency for application functionality

## Development Considerations
This application requires the following backend services to be operational:
- [ ] Mathematical engine
- [ ] Expression parser
- [ ] History storage
- [ ] Sharing service

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Component**: `web/js/apps/calculator.js`
- **Desktop Integration**: Application icon selector `[data-app="calculator"]`
- **Icon**: ðŸ§®
- **Registered Application**: âœ… Yes

## Parallel Development Strategy
To enable parallel frontend and backend development:

1. **Mock Backend Services**: Create mock implementations of required backend dependencies
2. **API Contracts**: Define clear API contracts for all backend services
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend components
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all dependencies and their interactions
