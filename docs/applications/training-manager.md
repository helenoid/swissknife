## Features
- Training coordination
- Progress monitoring
- Resource management
- Model versioning

## Backend Dependencies
- **Training frameworks**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Distributed computing**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Model registry**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Progress tracking**: Core dependency for application functionality

## Development Considerations
This application requires the following backend services to be operational:
- [ ] Training frameworks
- [ ] Distributed computing
- [ ] Model registry
- [ ] Progress tracking

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Component**: `web/js/apps/training-manager.js`
- **Desktop Integration**: Application icon selector `[data-app="training-manager"]`
- **Icon**: ðŸŽ¯
- **Registered Application**: âœ… Yes

## Parallel Development Strategy
To enable parallel frontend and backend development:

1. **Mock Backend Services**: Create mock implementations of required backend dependencies
2. **API Contracts**: Define clear API contracts for all backend services
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend components
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all dependencies and their interactions
