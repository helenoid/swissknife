![device-manager Icon](../screenshots/device-manager-icon.png)

## Description
Manage local and remote devices with hardware acceleration

## Screenshots
- **Icon**: ![Icon](../screenshots/device-manager-icon.png)
- **Application Window**: ![Window](../screenshots/device-manager-window.png)

## Features
- Device detection
- Hardware acceleration
- Performance monitoring
- Resource allocation

## Backend Dependencies
- **Device detection**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Hardware abstraction**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **WebGPU**: Core dependency for application functionality
- **Performance monitoring**: Core dependency for application functionality

## Development Considerations
This application requires the following backend services to be operational:
- [ ] Device detection
- [ ] Hardware abstraction
- [ ] WebGPU
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Component**: `web/js/apps/device-manager.js`
- **Desktop Integration**: Application icon selector `[data-app="device-manager"]`
- **Icon**: ðŸ”§
- **Registered Application**: âœ… Yes

## Parallel Development Strategy
To enable parallel frontend and backend development:

1. **Mock Backend Services**: Create mock implementations of required backend dependencies
2. **API Contracts**: Define clear API contracts for all backend services
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend components
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all dependencies and their interactions
