## Features
- AI code completion and intelligent suggestions
- Live preview with hot reload capabilities
- Template system for rapid application development
- Multi-panel interface with editor, preview, and console
- WebNN/WebGPU powered performance optimization
- Streamlit component library integration
- Real-time collaboration capabilities

## Backend Dependencies
- **Monaco editor**: Advanced code editing with syntax highlighting
- **Streamlit runtime**: Application execution and preview environment
- **AI code generation**: OpenAI/Anthropic for code assistance
- **File system**: Project file management and persistence
- **WebNN/WebGPU**: Hardware acceleration for performance
- **Template engine**: Pre-built application templates

## Development Considerations
This application requires the following backend services to be operational:
- [ ] Monaco editor
- [ ] Streamlit runtime
- [ ] AI code generation
- [ ] File system
- [ ] WebNN/WebGPU
- [ ] Template engine

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Component**: `web/js/apps/vibecode.js`
- **Desktop Integration**: Application icon selector `[data-app="vibecode"]`
- **Icon**: ðŸŽ¯
- **Registered Application**: âœ… Yes

## Parallel Development Strategy
To enable parallel frontend and backend development:

1. **Mock Streamlit Runtime**: Create mock environment for testing UI components
2. **AI Service Mocks**: Mock code completion and generation services
3. **File System Abstraction**: Implement mock file operations for development
4. **Template System**: Create static template system for initial development

## Technical Implementation
- **Editor Integration**: Monaco editor with Streamlit-specific syntax highlighting
- **Live Preview**: Real-time application preview with hot reload
- **AI Assistance**: Context-aware code suggestions and generation
- **Performance**: WebNN/WebGPU acceleration for complex applications
- **Collaboration**: Real-time code sharing and collaborative editing

## Development Priority
**HIGH PRIORITY** - VibeCode is a core development tool that enables rapid application creation within the SwissKnife ecosystem. Its AI-powered features make it essential for productive development workflows.
