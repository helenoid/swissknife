## Quality Issue
<!-- Describe the quality assurance need -->

## Current State
<!-- Describe the current state of testing, quality, or CI/CD -->
- [ ] No tests exist
- [ ] Tests are broken
- [ ] Tests are incomplete
- [ ] Code quality tools missing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline broken
- [ ] Performance issues

## Target State
<!-- Describe what quality assurance should look like when complete -->

## Quality Goals
<!-- Define specific quality metrics and targets -->
- [ ] Test coverage: ___% target
- [ ] Build time: Under ___ seconds
- [ ] Linting: 0 errors
- [ ] Type checking: 0 errors
- [ ] Security: No critical vulnerabilities

## Files to Create/Fix
<!-- List the specific files that need work -->
- [ ] `test/unit/feature.test.ts`
- [ ] `test/integration/workflow.test.ts`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] Quality configuration files

## Testing Strategy
<!-- Define the comprehensive testing approach -->

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Core business logic
- [ ] Utility functions
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Edge cases

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Component interactions
- [ ] API integrations
- [ ] Database operations
- [ ] External services

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Complete user workflows
- [ ] CLI command execution
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] Performance under load

## Code Quality Tools
<!-- Define what quality tools should be implemented -->
- [ ] ESLint configuration
- [ ] Prettier formatting
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Dependency auditing

## CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
<!-- Define what the CI/CD pipeline should include -->
- [ ] Automated testing on PR
- [ ] Code quality checks
- [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Build verification
- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Setup testing framework properly
2. [ ] Write comprehensive test suite
3. [ ] Configure code quality tools
4. [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline
5. [ ] Add performance monitoring
6. [ ] Document quality processes

## Quality Metrics
<!-- Define how success will be measured -->
- **Test Coverage**: Target ___% line coverage
- **Build Time**: Target under ___ seconds
- **Test Execution**: Target under ___ seconds
- **Code Quality**: 0 linting errors
- **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities

## Dependencies
<!-- List any issues that must be completed first -->
- Depends on: Infrastructure fixes
- Requires: Feature implementations to be testable

## Risk Assessment
<!-- What could go wrong and how to mitigate -->
- **False Positives**: How to handle flaky tests
- **Performance Impact**: How to keep CI fast
- **Maintenance Burden**: How to keep quality tools updated

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- [ ] All quality tools configured and working
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational
- [ ] Quality metrics meet targets
- [ ] Team can maintain quality standards
- [ ] Documentation for quality processes complete
