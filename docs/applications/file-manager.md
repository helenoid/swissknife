## Parallel Development Strategy
To enable parallel frontend and backend development:

1. **Mock Backend Services**: Create mock implementations of required backend dependencies
2. **API Contracts**: Define clear API contracts for all backend services
3. **Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for both frontend and backend components
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all dependencies and their interactions
