# SwissKnife - AI Development Toolkit 

> **⚠️ Current Status**: This project is undergoing major infrastructure repair. See [REPOSITORY_AUDIT_REPORT.md](REPOSITORY_AUDIT_REPORT.md) for current state and [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for roadmap.

A TypeScript-based AI development toolkit designed to provide unified access to AI models, task management, and development workflows.

## 🚨 Important Notice

**This repository currently has critical infrastructure issues that prevent normal usage.** We are actively working to resolve these issues through a systematic approach. Please see our implementation plan for current progress.

### Current Status:
- ❌ **Build System**: TypeScript configuration errors prevent compilation
- ❌ **Testing**: Jest infrastructure is broken
- ❌ **Dependencies**: Multiple package manager conflicts
- 🔧 **Features**: Partially implemented, not fully functional
- 📝 **Documentation**: Being updated to reflect actual state

## 📋 What We're Fixing

### Priority 1: Infrastructure (In Progress)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript configuration and module resolution errors
- [ ] Repair Jest testing infrastructure  
- [ ] Standardize dependency management
- [ ] Get basic build system working

### Priority 2: Documentation (Planned)
- [ ] Remove empty placeholder documentation files
- [ ] Update README to reflect actual capabilities
- [ ] Synchronize API documentation with implementation
- [ ] Create accurate getting started guide

### Priority 3: Feature Completion (Planned)
- [ ] Complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
- [ ] Fix Graph-of-Thought system type errors
- [ ] Complete IPFS integration
- [ ] Implement missing CLI commands

### Priority 4: Quality Assurance (Planned)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add code quality tools and standards
- [ ] Setup production CI/CD pipeline

## 🛠️ For Contributors

If you want to help fix this project, please:

1. **Check Current Issues**: Review [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed breakdown of work needed
2. **Pick an Issue**: Choose from the GitHub issues created for parallel development
3. **Follow Templates**: Use the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
4. **Test Infrastructure First**: Start with Priority 1 infrastructure issues

### Setting Up Development Environment (Currently Broken)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/swissknife.git
cd swissknife

# ⚠️ NOTE: The following commands currently fail due to infrastructure issues

# Install dependencies (currently has conflicts)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Try to build (currently fails with 1000+ TypeScript errors)
npm run build

# Try to run tests (currently fails - Jest configuration broken)
npm run test
```

## 🎯 Intended Features (When Fixed)

This project aims to provide:

- **🤖 AI Agent System**: Sophisticated reasoning and tool usage capabilities
- **🌐 Graph-of-Thought Engine**: Complex problem decomposition and reasoning
- **📋 Task Management**: Advanced scheduling and coordination
- **💾 Storage Integration**: IPFS and virtual filesystem support
- **🖥️ CLI Interface**: Rich terminal-based user experience
- **🔌 MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server implementation

## 📚 Documentation

### Current Documentation Status:
- **Comprehensive**: Extensive architectural documentation exists
- **Outdated**: Much documentation doesn't match current implementation
- **Incomplete**: Many placeholder files are empty
- **Being Updated**: Systematic review and updates in progress
